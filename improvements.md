### 1. Implement a Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for individual components to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the integration points between your application components to verify they work together correctly.
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage to ensure most of your codebase is tested. Tools like Coverage.py can help in measuring this.
- **Mock External Services:** Use mocking libraries like pytest-mock or responses to mock external API calls or database interactions.(Or FactoryBoy)

### 2. Improve Application Structure
- **Modular Design:** Organize application into modules or packages based on functionality to improve maintainability.

### 3. Language Model (LLM)-based word translation, synonyms, and usage examples provider service which involves several core components to ensure functionality, user satisfaction, and scalability. 
#### Gcloud has no service for providing information about word's synonyms and usage examples. There is a few options to solve the problem with third party API's, but  better to create our own service based on LLM's.
- This service utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to offer users translations of words between languages, provide synonyms within the same language, and present usage examples to understand context and application.
